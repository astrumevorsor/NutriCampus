As I write this, the goals of Nutricampus are

Provides a personalized and comprehensive solution to meal planning and ordering for college students specific dietary preferences, nutritional goals, and budget constraints. We know that currently,
college students have a meal plan/dining hall plan and they also sometimes doordash/uber eats/take out and cook on their own. We also know that irrespective of some laws
majority of college students do indulge in alcohol. This can be done without getting fat. 
My idea offers innovative and unique features, such as first up, recipe/meal recommendations, for people who want to cook on their own, with ingredient prices, where to get them and quantities, and macros with budget and their dietary preferences in mind.
I also understand that college students do not necessarily know how to cook very well or do not necessarily have time on hand, so we can take that into account and either recommend the simplest recipes that meet their goals or even restaurants that meet their budget and dietary preferences.
I like being flexible, so we can incorporate some features that are based on the mood of the user, i.e. if they're craving fries, maybe suggest ordering out fries or making your own fries which are low calorie and similar to the restaurant fries. 
Building a social community around the app that allows users to connect with other students and workers who share their interests and dietary preferences, eating food/showing off your own creations is useful.

Dopamine is a powerful tool and reinforcing positive behavior through healthy interaction with food and following the meal plan, maybe gamification of certain elements can help. 

Joke: Maybe also reward doing dishes

These are subject to change as the idea evolves and obviously will change as we shift to a more concrete approach.
